# Adventure text game in Rust.


## Directions
- Take the main.rs file and add to it using conditional logic to create a complete game.
- The game (at at least one point) must go **5 levels deep.** i.e. There must be at least one point in the conditional logic that will require 5 conditional checks to reach the (5th) end point.
- You may start from scratch if you prefer.
